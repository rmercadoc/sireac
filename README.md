Python music xml feature parser developed primarily for the [museres](https://museres.herokuapp.com) research.

The main purpose in to identify music features from musicXML files, to further use this information 
and the results from museres' [survey](https://museres.herokuapp.com/survey) to develop a music chord
recommender system that aims to help new composers to achieve the desired sentiment on their pieces 
recommending the use of various harmonies.

I'm developing this as part of my thesis for my application for the graduate degree of software engineer.
